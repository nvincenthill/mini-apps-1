The homepage of your application should have a Checkout button, which when clicked, takes the user to the first of several forms. We'll call the forms F1, F2, F3.

F1 collects name, email, and password for account creation.
F2 collects ship to address (line 1, line 2, city, state, zip code) and phone number.
F3 collects credit card #, expiry date, CVV, and billing zip code.
At each step, a Next button allows the user to progress to the next step in the checkout process. The final step is a confirmation page which summarizes the data collected in the prior three steps. This page contains a Purchase button that completes the purchase. When the purchase is complete, the user is returned to the homepage.

No actual shopping cart or products are necessary; you are modeling the checkout process only.

Every run through the checkout process (each time Checkout is clicked) creates a new record in your server's database, and each step in the checkout process saves its piece of the data to that record (the data is saved when Next is clicked).

Use the coding best practices you learned previously to ensure a clear separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces.
